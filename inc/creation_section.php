            Portfolio - Client vs Project(summary) vs Category
              => One client can have many projects, but each project belongs to exactly one client
              => So, we implement this relationship by listing projects (not clients), so that every record is unique (project thumbnail)
              e.g Logo (thumbnail(Link to live project(website, page, etc))) => Makana Supplies Ltd (Client_Link) => Brand Identity(Cat_Link)
                  Logo (thumbnail) => Popcorn Media Ltd => Brand Identity
                  Website (screenshot) => Popcorn Media Ltd => Websites
                  JSON
            Brand Identity
            Clients (They Trust us or We're Trusted - their logos (in round containers)): Roofings, Banana Village, Popcorn Media, Nansana Youth, C3
